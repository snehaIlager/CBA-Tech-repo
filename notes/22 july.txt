React is using virtual DOM in memory  which allows it to efficiently update the actual browser.
Efficiently update the actual broswer DOM by only rendering the necessary changes  to get improved performance.

jsx - javascript XML which is a syntax extension allows writing HTML like code within javascript language which makes easier to define UI structure.

Everything in react is trated as a component.

SPA - sinle page application..same url for all pages...when u click links the url wont change in the tab, 
but in other websites if we see the url keep changes if we click on links that are available in the website, it takes to different pages.


we write arrow function just like in javascript we wrote.
These arrow functions are used to write functions where they are used as also variables , that is an advantage of it.
