finite set of statements that grantees an optimal solution in finite interval of time - algorithm , 

GOOD ALGORITHM?
run in less time
consume less memory

RUNNING TIME OF AN ALGORITHM:
depends upon:
input size
nature of input

Time complexity of binary search algorithm :
O(log n)

O(n!) - highest time complexity

best case time complexity of linear search - 0(1)

time complexity of merge sort in worst case- O(n logn)
